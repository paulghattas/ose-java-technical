# OpenShift Technical Demo
This demonstration uses:

* JBoss EAP
* HAProxy status widget
* App scaling (HAProxy)
* MySQL integration

It is intended to show off many of the "basic" features of OpenShift and give
some insight into how apps are deployed in the infrastructure.

## Future Features
* show some information from the EAP cluster
* "kill" button + watchman
* Jenkins integration

## Maybe nice to haves?
* Netflix-y stuff 
  * hystrix for MySQL connection
  * hystrix for message broker
